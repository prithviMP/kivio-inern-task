# Kivio Intern Hiring Challenge Submission

I have successfully implemented a backend that handles payments via Razorpay, captures the details of the payment through a webhook, and stores the details as leads in Zoho CRM. I have used Node.js for this task.

I also tried my hand at the frontend task. I was able to implement three categories of screens using Flutter and Dart - the intro screen, the onboarding screens, and the login screens. The screens are also mobile responsive.

Here is the demo recording of my submission -
